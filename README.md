### running

<br>

#### project structure

<br>

- `lakefile.lean`: the lean package manager configuration file
- `src.lean`: the main entry point for the source code
- `src/Basics.lean`: basic examples and concepts
- `src/SimpleProofs_*.lean`: more advanced concepts and examples for proofs
- `Makefile`

<br>

#### `make build`

<br>

run all `*.lean` files with:

```shell
make build

Build completed successfully.
```

<br>

#### basic types and functions

<br>

run `Basics.lean` with:

```shell
make run-basic
```

<br>


#### simple proofs for simple theorems

<br>

* theorem to prove `2(n + m) = 2n + 2m`
* theorem to prove the relationship between double and addition
* theorem to prove double of zero is zero


<br>

run `proofs/SimpleProofs_*.lean` (replace `*` with `I` or `II`, etc.):

```shell
make run-simple_proofs_*
```
